## Invasion of DronEx

Walking across the Sungo Valley Highschool football field with Sara and Colin was like stepping back in time. It had been nearly five years since we saw each other at our class of 2010 graduation.  Colin excitedly threw a coin into the old wishing well and closed his eyes while making his wish. Seconds after the splash, a DronEx flew up to Sara. “Sara, please grab the mail on your way home.” the voice of Sara’s mother voice bellowed.

DronEx had barely finished broadcasting the message when another DronEx flew up to Colin. The voices of Colin’s parents rang out in unison, “Colin don’t forget you have a piano lesson after school today.” 

Sara summoned a DronEx and stated clearly, “Yes, mother. Send.” 
That DronEx no sooner flew off when another one arrived in front of Sara, with the message ringing out, “Sara, are you guys coming to the dance tonight?” This time the DronEx hung around for a return message. No surprise there. After all, Sara’s boyfriend, Sebastian, was crazy rich and would be considered rude if he sent a DronEx without paying for the reply DronEx. “Hang on, boy-toy. I am getting bombarded by DronEx today.” said Sara with a teasing tone. Sara listened to incoming messages one after another and quickly replied seamlessly to all of them.

Colin was busily juggling multiple DronEx when Sara burst out in song. “Happy Birthday, dear Susan, happy birthday to you!” Sara sang. “DronEx, Send.” 

I was so overwhelmed by all the DronEx and annoyed that the conversations excluded me. It would have been nice to have actual conversations with my friends, even if just for one day. Since the development of the DronEx, many people had become addicted to sending messages. They no longer talked to each other face-to-face. It was like the ability to message anyone at any time created the need to share every thought the instant it occurred. 

Thirteen minutes and an unknown number of DronEx messages later, Colin and Sara decided to grab lunch at the café. I was exhausted just from the chaos of them summoning and sending DronEx messages simultaneously. The mere thought of hearing them, the DronEx, and the voices of their contacts gave me indigestion. 
“I am going to go for a walk through the park. I will catch up with you guys later,” I announced. 

“Okay.” they chimed in unison. “Catch ya later!”

Enjoying the calming sounds of nature, I sat down on the first park bench I came across. It was half-shaded by a Willow tree. Feeling the sun and a cool breeze gently graze my face, I quickly drifted off into dreamland for a much need break from reality. 

It seemed like mere seconds had passed when I was abruptly awoken by young children chatting messages to their parents that they were at the park with friends and safely having fun. Teenagers were chin-wagging messages to be sent to teenagers on the other side of the park. Seniors were sitting on a nearby bench listening to the voices of their grandchildren come from a DronEx.

The noise was getting to me. I needed quiet. Every person was preoccupied, bustling, and did not appear bothered by that pestilential whirring sound of the DronEx, obstructing all rational thought. It sounded like the magnified toing and froing of a swarm of colossal mosquitoes. Add in the sound of people talking, walking, and biking, along with the unrelenting exhaust fume smell of DronEx, and you may imagine my waking moment in the park. I had hoped to embrace the sounds and smells of nature. There was no way I could have foreseen that number of DronEx Messenger users nor the flight response of my nervous system to pandemonium.

I understand why this advanced version of honing pigeons was considered progress, but had I been forewarned that this was the day the marketing department at DronEx had offered free messaging for 24 hours in hopes of capturing millions of new subscribers, I would have stayed home. From what I saw, their ploy was a great success. At least with getting the general public to try out this new fad of speaking to the drone a message it would take to your intended recipient. I will continue visiting with people in person as much as possible for as long as culturally acceptable. It won’t be long until this fad ends, and some new media technology renders the use of the DronEx obsolete. What would be next? 



## Micro Essay

My story takes place in an alternative universe where I speculate on what the media technology culture would look like in 2015 had SMS (short message service, (i.e., texting) never been invented. Culturally, humans still evolved to waste precious time sharing every thought and detail of their lives, with no concern of what the recipient is doing at that moment in time, with impersonal social interactions.

The central premise of this tale is as Jussi Parikka writes: “That new media remediates old media.” Meaning that new media is designed and/or constructed based on old media and made with newer technology that is considered somehow to correct the flaws or shortcomings of the old media. It suggests that this new media will improve upon old while keeping the old media’s fundamental purpose.  Since humans liked and used this media, they are presumed to enjoy the new media.

The idea and use of carrier/homing pigeons to deliver written(and now digital) messages to their home loft for pickup by the intended recipient, or their runner, was created long ago and utilized mainly to send secret messages in the war at first. The idea of sending messages is not new. However, the delivery apparatus, as inspired by old media, is. In this case, the media is DronEx, a tiny drone that records the dispatcher’s verbal message and then flies to the recipient, wherever they may be, and plays back that message to them. One difference between the new from the old is that DronEx can be programmed digitally to fly to any destination.

In contrast, a homing pigeon flew only to one destination, and it was up to the humans to physically pick up the message from that destination. Also, DronEx induces noise and air pollution, leading to human instinction. But that’s a story for another day.  

I hope this short story will entice readers to engage in critical and abstract thinking and discussions about media temporalities. What happens when you put the cart before the horse’? Or alter the cart, the horse, or both? No need to re-invent the wheel. Repurpose it.
